# Overview

The Django Student Management System is a collaborative web application designed to streamline the management of student records for educational institutions. Built with Django, this platform enables administrators and authorized users to securely register, log in, and manage student data through an intuitive dashboard. Key features include adding, editing, viewing, and deleting student records, advanced search and filtering, and a contact form for feedback or inquiries. The application emphasizes security, user experience, and responsive design, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. Developed as a group project, each team member contributed to different aspects of the system, ensuring a robust and user-friendly solution for student management needs.
